Dickson;5.8;Documentary, Short;Performing on what looks like a small wooden stage, wearing a dress with a hoop skirt and white high-heeled pumps, Carmencita does a dance with kicks and twirls, a smile always on her face.::<jhailey@hotmail.com>, Presumably, the first woman ever to appear in a Kinetoscope film and possibly the first woman to take part in a motion picture in the United States, the Spaniard dancer, Carmencita, performs her appealing high-kick dance in front of the camera of William K.L. Dickson and William Heise, for Thomas Edison. In this segment of her New York music-hall act, she spins and twirls, exhibiting an admirable talent, a fashionable dress, and a really charming smile.::Nick Riganas
