Minimalistic and devoid of the usual special effects which made famous the French illusionist and pioneering filmmaker, this is, indeed, a rather simple story; however, what it lacks in innovation it makes up for humour and irony. Exactly 125km outside of the bustling city of Paris, a not-so-vigilant sentry is assigned the relatively easy task of guarding a blank white wall where postering is strictly forbidden. But, when the guard marches past the partition, an audacious bill poster plasters the surface with an advertisement--and moments later--another bold worker pastes up yet another poster.

Sent to Devil's Island, the unfortunate officer spends his time within the Palisade outside his prison, until he's put in leg irons due to innuendo published by an anti-Dreyfusard newspaper. Around the same time, Major Hubert-Joseph Henry, who admitted forging evidence against Dreyfus, commits suicide in prison by the means of a razor concealed in his luggage. Because of this, it is now decided Dreyfus must be tried again in Rennes, where he is reunited with his wife during his imprisonment. Then, several weeks before the trial, the defense attorney Fernand Labori is attacked by an anonymous anti-Dreyfusard attacker who was never identified. Thankfully, he survives in time to present his case. Finally, since the anti-Dreyfusard claims are still at work, the second trial again results in condemnation; and because the eleven-part serial was made seven years before acquittal, the director never managed to entirely depict the entire story.

They are then pursued by a Sheriff's posse. Several scenes have color included - all hand tinted.::garykmcd Four gunmen plan to rob a train, not only of its cargo, such as money, but the valuables on the possession of the passengers. They are not averse to shooting to kill anyone who is out of line, which includes anyone not listening to their instructions. To pull off their plan, they have to subdue the manager of the station where they plan to board the train, board without anyone noticing that they are doing so, subdue anyone guarding the cargo, and take over the engine so that they stop the train to corral the passengers in one area while they are being robbed, and then make their getaway. Even if they are able to get to this stage, they may have to deal with those who now know what they've done, a posse which very well may be on its way.::Huggo Two bandits break into a train station. They threaten a man with a gun, then hide to deliver a letter without being discovered and then beat the man. They get on board the train that stop by letting the passengers get off.

171;La guirlande merveilleuse;1903;Georges Méliès;5.4;Short Fantasy;"A musketeer bows to the audience and proceeds to hang his hat, coat and vest on the wall in a most amazing manner. Being in need of two pages, he brings them out of his coat, and with rope he makes a hoop. The two pages stretch out a large sheet of white paper. The musketeer puts the hoop through the paper, and instantly the hoop is all covered with paper like those used by performers in the circus. The pages hold up the hoop; the paper bursts, only to let out a hideous clown, who goes and sits in the corner to see what is going to happen. Then the musketeer breaks the hoop, takes out of his hat a lot of flowers, which he throws on the pieces of the hoop, and by his act he makes a lovely wreath, from which appears a beautiful woman. This woman is then substituted by an immense and grinning face, into which the clown jumps. Then an explosion is heard and nothing is left of the clown nor the head. The musketeer takes the pages on his soldiers, one after the other, and they are changed as his coat and hat. Finally he disappears in a most mysterious way.::Méliès Catalog"
172;Kit Carson;1903;Wallace McCutcheon;5.7;Short Western;"Kit Carson is captured by Indians and tied to a tree in the Indian village. An Indian maiden helps him make his escape.::Anonymous This subject is a production upon which was spent a great deal of time and money. It was taken amid scenery of the wildest natural beauty and enacted with the greatest possible fidelity to the original. The costumes, arms, log cabins, etc., are all historically correct. The story embodies the adventures of the greatest of all the American scouts and pathfinders, ""Kit Carson,"" his life in the wilderness, his hand-to-hand conflicts with the savage Indians, his hairbreadth escapes and his safe return to his log cabin home in the clearing. The subject is absolutely a novelty in moving pictures. 1. MORNING IN THE WILDERNESS. As the dawn breaks, Kit Carson and his fellow trapper are seen awakening from their pine bough couches. They wash at the brook, start a fire and prepare their frugal meal. This finished, they remove all trace of the fire, arrange their packs, take their rifles and start off into the depths of the forest. 2. INDIANS FIND THE TRAIL. The same scene. The trappers have departed and a band of painted Indians appear. They discover the trail of the trappers, and after a brief conference start out after them. 3 IN CAMP FOR THE NIGHT. Here we seee Kit Carson and his companion, fatigued by the weary tramp of the day, locating their camp by the side of another stream. The evening meal is cooked and the trappers lie down to sleep. 4. THE NIGHT ATTACK. While Kit and his companion are asleep, the Indians make their treacherous attack. The fight is short and bloody. Three of the savages are laid low, but Kit's companion is killed and Kit himself after a terrific struggle, is taken captive and bound. 5. OVER THE LOG. Here we see the exultant savages and their captive threading their way through the dense growth of the forest. They come to a stream which is spanned by a large birch log. Over this the Indians pass in single file, followed by Kit, his arms bound but all senses alert. One buck brings up the rear. As Kit reaches the center of the log, he engages the attention of the buck for an instant, then quick as a flash topples him into the water, and springing into the water on the opposite side, Kit is lost to view. The other Indians come running back and plunge through the water in their eager search for Kit. 6. THE CANOE CHASE. A wild river. On either side immense pine trees. Around a distant turn Kit is seen coming in his canoe, paddling for dear life. He is followed by three other canoes, filled with Indians, all paddling desperately. Kit fires at the foremost canoe and all disappear around another bend of the river. 7. ARRIVAL OF THE INDIAN SCOUT. Farther down the river an Indian scout is seen rapidly approaching in his canoe. He runs his frail craft ashore and tells his companions of the coming of Kit. 8. ATTACK ON CANOE AND SECOND CAPTURE OF KIT. The Indians who have been warned in the preceding scene hide in ambush. Kit comes along in his canoe unconscious of this new danger. As he comes opposite the ambush, the savages, naked save for their breech-clothes, jump into the water, overturn the canoe, and after another thrilling conflict the intrepid Kit is again a prisoner. 9. IN THE INDIAN CAMP. This is a remarkable scene. Here we have the Indian village, with its skin-covered tepees. Squaws and their papooses, young bucks and Indian maidens are seen at their various occupations. Here we have real Indian life. Kit is brought into camp by his captors and his advent creates great excitement. He is tied to a tree and subjected to various tortures and indignities, which he bears with undaunted mein. Even when tomahawks are hurled at his head he does not falter. Night comes, and the life of the village is stilted. Kit is guarded by one brave, who sleeps on his rifle by the fire. Death seems very near, but help is near at hand. An Indian maiden, moved to compassion by his condition, severs his bonds and once again Kit is free. 10. THE HOME IN THE WILDERNESS. Here we see Kit's rude log cabin in the clearing. His wife and children are busy with household affairs and eagerly watching for the return of the father. A little girl runs in with the glad news, and soon Kit stalks in and is quickly overwhelmed by the loving embraces of his wife and children.::Biograph Bulletin"
173;Life of an American Fireman;1903;George S. Fleming Edwin S. Porter;6.4;Short Action;"A fireman rushes into a carriage to rescue a woman from a house fire.

After dangerous and uncertain moments, the fireman save the woman' s son, too.::luigicavaliere Porter's sequential continuity editing links several shots to form a narrative of firemen responding to a house fire. They leave the station with their horse drawn pumper, arrive on the scene, and effect the safe rescue of a woman from the burning house. But wait, she tells them of her child yet asleep in the burning bedroom . . .::Thomas McWilliams <tgm@netcom.com> It would be difficult for the exhibitor to conceive the amount of work involved and the number of rehearsals necessary to produce a film of this description. We were compelled to enlist the services of the fire departments of four different cities, New York, Newark, Orange, and East Orange, N. J., and about 300 firemen appear in the various scenes. From the first conception of this wonderful series of pictures it was our aim to portray the ""Life of an American Fireman"" without exaggeration, and at the same time to embody the dramatic situations and spectacular effects which so greatly enhance a motion picture performance. The work of American fire departments is known throughout the world, and the fame of the American fireman is echoed around the entire world. He is known to be the most expert, as well as the bravest, of all fire fighters. This film faithfully and accurately depicts his thrilling and dangerous calling and emphasizes the perils he encounters when human life is at stake, every movement of the brave firemen and their perfectly trained horses from the moment the men leap from their beds in response to an alarm until the fire is extinguished and a woman and child are rescued after many fierce battles with flame and smoke.::Edison Catalog"

After using pitch-black boot polish as a makeshift make-up, the reckless servant sets her mind on starting a fire--and when all else fails--Mary grabs a paraffin can, pours liberally on the seemingly extinguished fire, and out the chimney she goes. Will her untimely demise be a warning to all kerosene lovers?::Nick Riganas Mary Jane tries to light the oven. When she's unsuccessful, she plays around, getting black boot polish on her face.

Is there any rest for the foolish, even in the grave?::<jhailey@hotmail.com> Mary Jane is a typical 'Hinglish girl. She is seen in her kitchen, having overslept herself, skurrying about, trying to do a number of things at one time. She blackens the Master's boots, puts the kettle on, builds the fire, etc., etc. While engaged in shoe-blacking, she scratches her nose with the blacking brush and leaves a large black mark on her face which makes it appear that Mary Jane has a mustache. However, she goes on with her work, but the fire will not come up. Mary runs for the paraffin can, and proceeds to pour about a quart of the fluid on the apparently extinguished fire, after which she kneels on the floor to blow some life into the old kitchen range. She evidently succeeds for, suddenly an awful explosion occurs and Mary is seen traveling heavenward. The picture changes to an exterior view. The housetops continue her flight toward angel land. Shortly after, she descends piecemeal and when the last piece has fallen the picture dissolves into a scene laid in a graveyard where poor Mary was interred. The inscription on the tombstone is to effect that Mary had gone to heaven by the aid of paraffin. An old lady accompanied by three younger ones visits the grave but are fightened off by the ghost of the departed kitchen maid who is seen in ghostly form tightly hugging the paraffin can. Exceedingly fine.::Lubin Catalog

But first, the leader needs to arrange the notes and place the G-clef on the lines. There he goes. Now, everything is ready for an unforgettable performance.::Nick Riganas A marching band appears, and the band-leader prepares to give them the music for the song he wants them to play. He has prepared a large staff above their heads, and he now creates notes by making duplicates of his own head, placing them on the staff, and completing the notes with sticks and other implements taken from the band members. When he has finished, the players attempt to perform the music that has been written in such an unusual fashion.::Snow Leopard A singing teacher, followed by his pupils, meet in the fields some telegraph wires strung on poles. These wires, the professor thinks, would form a very effective musical staff. He carries an enormous key of G which he throws upon the wires to give the proper pitch to his pupils. He forms a measure by fixing his cane in a perpendicular position among the wires which run in parallel direction, thus forming the lines of a staff of music. In order to have notes, he tears off his own head and fixes it among the wires. Thus he obtained the first note of his air. Then he fixes upon this staff several heads corresponding in position to the first part of the tune, ""God Save the King."" One hears the beating of drums, the heads rearrange themselves and one sees the second line of the air. Another beating of drums, and the heads shift about until they form the third line of music. Satisfied, the professor departs, followed by his pupils. The heads, abandoned among the wires, cast a look at the crowd as it disappears. Immediately they are changed to birds and fly away. This subject, accompanied by the proper music, produces great laughter.::Lubin Catalog"

183;The Great Train Robbery;1903;Siegmund Lubin;7.1;Short Western;The first scene shows the chief as he explains to his followers the plan of the great train robbery. Two masked robbers enter and compel the operator to stop the approaching train. They make him write an order to the engineer to take water at this station instead of at the regular watering stop. The train stops, the conductor comes to the office window, where the operator delivers the order while the bandits keep their revolvers trained on him. No sooner has the conductor left when they bind and gag the operator, and hastily depart to catch the moving train. This scene shows the train at the water tank. The bandits are hiding behind the tank, and just before the train pulls out they quickly board the express car wherein the messenger is busily engaged with his duties. Alarmed by the unusual sound, the messenger unlocks the door, peeps through the keyhole, discovers the bandits and quickly locks the iron boxes which contain the valuables. He then throws the key through small window and pulls out his revolver to defend the valuables entrusted to him. Two robbers succeed in entering the car. The messenger bravely attacks them and discharges his revolver, but he is quickly laid low by a bullet. The bandits bind and gag him and then try to open the treasure box. When they find it locked they search the messenger for the key, and as they do not find it, they blow up the strong box with dynamite. They take the valuables and the mail bags and quickly leave the car. During all this time the train is seen flying past beautiful scenery. While two of the robbers blow up the strong box in the express car, two other ones hold the engineer and the fireman at pistols' point. The fireman takes a coal shovel and climbs up on the tender to defend himself and his position, but he soon finds himself overpowered and thrown from the swiftly moving train. The two bandits then compel the engineer to stop the train. Forced by the robbers, the engineer brings the train to a stop, uncouples the engine and pulls ahead about two hundred feet, always covered by the bandits' pistols. In the meantime two of the bandits compel the passengers to leave the coaches with hands up. They line them up along the tracks, go through their pockets and relieve them of all their valuables. One passenger makes an attempt to escape, but is instantly shot down by one of the bandits. As soon as they have all the booty the bandits mount the engine and make good their escape, while the passengers lend their helping hand to their unfortunate friend who is badly wounded by one of the bandits. The bandits bring all the booty on the locomotive and command the engineer to pull the lever and pretty soon we see them disappear in the distance. Far out in the rough countries the bandits command the engineer to stop, descend from the engine, and escape to the mountains with the stolen goods. This scene shows the bandits coming down from the mountains into the valley, where they cross a stream to get to a place of safety. The scenery is truly beautiful. One of the robbers, in his hurry, slips and falls in the water, but he quickly rises and makes good his escape. This scene brings us back to the interior of the telegraph office, where the operator lies bound and gagged on the floor. After a desperate struggle he succeeds in reaching the table where his instruments stand. He telegraphs for help and manipulates the key with his mouth, and then falls to the floor, fainting from exhaustion. The operator's little daughter enters to bring him his daily dinner. She finds her father bound, kneels down, praying to the Lord to give her strength to help her poor father, throws a glass of water in his face, restoring him to consciousness, takes a knife and cuts the ropes and removes the gag from his mouth. This typical Western dance hall shows some men in company with women. A tenderfoot appears upon the scene and is made to dance in the regular Western style. Suddenly the door opens, the operator's little daughter enters and relates what has happened. The men quickly stop their merriment, take their guns and leave in pursuit of the outlaws. The bandits are seen dashing through the woods on spirited horses followed closely by the Sheriff and a large posse. One of the bandits is shot and falls from his horse, but he staggers to his feet again and kills one of the Deputy Sheriffs before he expires. This scene shows the bandits in a fierce fight with the Sheriff's posse. The bandits dismount their horses, and, not thinking that the Sheriff and his Deputy were so near, are just beginning to look over their booty when suddenly the Sheriff and his Deputies appear on the scene. A desperate battle takes place, and, after a brave stand the bandits and several of the pursuers breathe their last. This scene shows a life-size picture of Daniels, the chief of the bandits, as he takes aim and fires into the audience. The picture is so realistic that women scream, and even though no sound is heard, they put their fingers in their ears to shut out the noise of the firing.::Lubin Catalog

The setting sun proclaimed it time to return to the city; the glorious day was at an end but not for little Joe. His chaperon had laid the book down at his very feet and now bustled about getting her charges ready for departure. Joe picked it up; the story all came back. He walked along the beach toward the setting sun. He found a boat without oars and not a soul in sight. A look at the book and the thought of his hovel called ""home"" helped him to make up his mind. His fairies had guided him to the shore and sent him a boat into which he climbed; he needed no oars because his fairy friends guided the boat and so he sailed out to sea, along the path of shining light to the land beyond the sunset.::Moving Picture World synopsis"

What a blow this was to the young wife, waiting for her dear one's return. Although the evidence was apparently conclusive, still she could not reconcile herself to the fact that her husband had gone from her forever; something in her heart tells that he still lives, and in truth, for we see the poor shipwrecked mariner cast up by the seething sea on to a desert island in the Western Ocean. Here he spent seven long, weary years, worse off that De Foe's famous hero, ""Robinson Crusoe,"" for he at least enjoyed the companionship of ""Friday,"" but Davis was all alone. Now and then a distant sail, like a tantalizing phantom, would come into view and fade away again from sight, being too far off to see his signals of distress. His only solace was the picture in a locket of her who was waiting, waiting, ever hopeful of his return; praying as, indeed, was he also, their prayers ascending at the same time to the Father Almighty, through whose Grace and Mercy they were both imbued with hope, for although she finds her lot arduous, the care of a child being an exacting responsibility, she has repeatedly rejected the suit of Tom Foster, a good fellow, who would care for her and her little one. But no, that intuition tells her John will return, although it seems at times she hopes in vain. However, John's prayers are at last answered, and a boat is sent from a passing ship to his rescue. Returning home unannounced, the sight that greets him freezes his blood, for there he sees his wife and Foster walking through the garden accompanied by the child. He at once concludes that he has been forgotten and his place taken by his friend. His soul is at first filled with revenge and he is about to strike Foster down, but no, she is happy. She thinks him dead, and why not let it be so? This would be the most kindly, so he slinks hack into the foliage, intending to go away forever. They pass into the house, leaving the little one playing on the lawn. He cannot resist folding the child his child to his heart.

231;The Bandit's Waterloo;1908;D.W. Griffith;5.6;Short Action;"The Outwitting of an Andalusian Brigand by a Pretty Senora. The hills of Southern Spain were infested by a gang of lawless freebooters who terrorized the country and made travel in the mountains a hazardous pastime. They waylaid, robbed and often murdered the unwary tourist who chanced their way. In the opening of this Biograph picture a party of these Andalusian bushrangers, in command of their chieftain, are seen hiding behind a huge rock in waiting for prey. They haven't long to wait, for after having held up and relieved several pedestrians, a stylish landau approaches in which are seated an old gentleman, a duenna, and a pretty young Senora. The inevitable happens; all are relieved of their valuables, and while the gentleman and duenna are sent on their way, the girl is held a prisoner. She realizes her helplessness, and at the same time assumes that her beauty has made an impression on the chief, hence resorts to woman's wiles to captivate the bandit. In this she succeeds, but must use strategy to regain her jewels, which are still in his possession. Her subtle artifice is promising, when they are surprised by the police, who take them in hand, but the sergeant finding them possessed of so much wealth, is content to take that and let them go. From here they go to the mountain inn, where later the sergeant again puts in an appearance, so Senora bribes the waiting maid to allow her to act in that capacity, and as the sergeant does not recognize her, she having been veiled when they met in the road, he is lured to a private room, where he is overpowered, bound and gagged by the bandit, who regains the jewels, and with Senora flees to another hostelry. Here Senora piles her conquest with cajolery and wine until he falls into a drunken sleep. Now is her chance. She secures her jewelry and after leaving a derisive letter for the enamored bandit, departs to rejoin her friends, chuckling in anticipation of the chagrin of the pillager upon his awakening.::Moving Picture World synopsis"
232;Behind the Scenes;1908;D.W. Griffith;5.4;Short Drama;"A mother works as a dancer to support her ill daughter. One night while performing, the mother has a vision of her child dying. She rushes home, but it is too late.::Anonymous Mrs. Bailey, the young widowed mother of a child, now ill, and with but faint chance of recovery, must undergo the torture of smilingly responding to the generous plaudits of a thoughtless throng at the theater, while her heart is torn with anguish that only a mother can appreciate, for ""Earth holds no symbol, has no living sign to image forth a mother's deathless love."" 'Tis the opening night of a big production at the opera house, and at eight o'clock we still find the distracted actress in her humble apartment bending over the wan figure of her little one, while her own mother stands by in mute distress. A knock at the door signals the entrance of the call-boy, with a note from the manager to say that she must come at once to the theater or suffer the loss of her position, a thing she can ill afford, as it furnishes the only revenue, meager as it is, with which she maintains her little home. Madly rushing to the theater, she hastens into her costume and appears at the entrance just as the curtain rises. Here is the crucial test of the actor's art. With heart as heavy as stone, she trips on to be greeted by the thousand smiling faces of pleasure-seekers in anxious anticipation of her dance, which is a feature of the performance. The dance over, she exits to be met by her mother, who has been sent by the doctor to bid her hurry home if she would see her loved one alive. Meanwhile there are storms of applause from an insistent public, soliciting an encore; hence she is aroused from her apparent lethargy by the stage manager, who fairly pushes her back on the stage. Again before the audience, her art befriends her, but in the course of the dance a mother's intuition asserts itself and in her mind's eye she sees her little one, but only for a moment, for the audience is thrown into a wild tumult, which tends to recall her to the exigencies of her position, and so she finishes the number. Dashing wildly from the theater to her home, she arrives, but too late. For when she meets the kind-hearted doctor at the door, her worst fears are confirmed. The scene that follows positively defies description, and we can only say that it is unquestionably the most powerful ever shown in motion pictures.::Moving Picture World synopsis"

Twenty minutes are allowed for them to get away, for the hands are now indicating 11:40. Certain death seems to be her fate, and would have been had not an accident disclosed her plight. Hendricks after leaving the place is thrown by a street car, and this serves to discover his identity, so he is captured and a wild ride is made to the house in which the poor girl is incarcerated. This incident is shown in alternate scenes. There is the helpless girl, with the clock ticking its way towards her destruction, and out on the road is the carriage, tearing along at breakneck speed to the rescue, arriving just in time to get her safely out of range of the pistol as it goes off. In conclusion we can promise this to be an exceedingly thrilling film, of more than ordinary interest.::Moving Picture World synopsis

254;For Love of Gold;1908;D.W. Griffith;6.6;Short Crime;"It is often said there is honor among thieves, but not so, as we shall see in this story. Two denizens of the underworld are seen in their squalid furnished room planning a robbery. Their intended victim is known to hold at all times in his safe at home a large sum of money and a wealth of jewels. Gathering together the tools of their nefarious calling, they start off, arriving at the house shortly after the master had retired for the night. Entrance is easily and noiselessly effected. A chloroform-soaked handkerchief soon puts the master beyond the power of interfering and the safe is broken open. The sight that greets them almost makes them gasp. There in this strong box is not only an enormous sum of money, but many valuable jewels as well, prominent among which is a handsome diamond necklace. All this is put into a cloth, and a hurried egress made. Back to their room they go to divide the spoils of their night's haul. The diamond necklace being an indivisible article, a contention is at once raised between the partners in crime. There is no way in which they seem able one to satisfy the other, so they drop the argument for the time being to eat lunch. One, to make sure that he shall be the possessor of the loot, drops poison in the coffee of his chum, Which he drinks, and is soon in the throes of convulsions, falling to the floor lifeless, while the other stands by sardonically gloating over his seeming victory; but his elation is short-lived, for he is now seized with the same agony and pitches forward alongside his partner. The two had played the same game, each unknown to the other. ""Honor among thieves?""-Bah!::Moving Picture World synopsis"
255;For a Wife's Honor;1908;D.W.

As he is about to leave, Henderson, the manager, calls to pay a sum due him for royalties. At the same time, Frank Wilson, a friend of the family, drops in. Henderson hands over to Robertson several thousand dollars and departs. He places the money temporarily in his desk and prepares for his journey, excusing himself to Wilson, at the same time begging him to make himself at home, he departs. Now with the family there was employed a French maid, whose carelessness just before this scene, incurred the displeasure of Mrs. Robertson, who discharged her. Wilson is a bank cashier and has fallen into the error of so many of his kind. As his peculations are detected, and well-grounded rumors already rife, he comes to ask the wise counsel of his friends. Robertson having departed, Wilson hesitatingly unburdens his mind to Mrs. Robertson, who, of course, is amazed at his recital. While they are engaged in whispered conversation, the maid, who has packed her belongings to leave, peeks in. An idea strikes her: a chance too good to lose, so she noiselessly reverses the key in the door and locks it from the outside, thus leaving the couple prisoners. Out of the house she rushes to overtake Robertson, which she does at the next corner. Loud and impressive are her defamations, which not only arouse the jealousy of the husband, but curiosity of the passersby as well. Back to the house dashes Robertson and upon finding the door locked, the maid's story seems only too true. Inside the room consternation had at first seized the couple, and then the wife accuses Wilson of duplicity: ""No, no! Not that! I'm not as low as that, but we must think, and think quickly. Ah! Go into that room."" The wife does as he commands and Wilson makes for the desk, bursts it open and is taking the money as Robertson, in a frenzy, crashes into the room. He slops short at the scene that greets his sight. There is his wife, whom he had for the moment doubted, coming from her room, and his most cherished friend standing over the wrecked desk with the implicating bank notes still in his hand. For an instant all seemed paralyzed: then from the husband: ""Go."" Wilson, with bowed head, leaves. He has chosen to hurl himself into the slough of degradation to save the honor of his friend's wife.::Moving Picture World synopsis"
256;The Girl and the Outlaw;1908;D.W. Griffith;5.1;Short Action Western;Bill Preston, a heartless roadabout, too despicable for the association of white men, had gathered about him a little band of low-down redskins, whom he seemed to rule by extreme despotism. At any rate, they all feared him, as he, with them, terrorized the whole country 'round, by acts of pillage, arson and worse. Bill, despite his black nature, was a handsome fellow, who, under different conditions, might be called attractive. This the case, there is reason why Nellie Carson, a girl of the frontier, should fall so violently in love with him, casting her lot with his. She soon finds out his true nature, but even then she seems to be held by an irresistible power, though, he would cast her off, which he tries to do, leaving her lying wounded and insensible in the road, after a stormy scene between them. She is discovered by a girl of the mountains, who offers to help her to her mountain home. Though moved by the girl's kindness, she rejects her offer, choosing to go her own way on the road of life she has picked out. The mountain girl drives off and is waylaid by Bill, who seizes her and brings her to his camp. Nellie, coming along later, discovers evidence of what has taken place, and with a feeling of pity for the girl, and jealousy of Bill, resolves to save her. She arrives at camp at nightfall and manages to release the girl and get away, but unfortunately her revolver drops to the ground, and exploding, awakens the gang. The girl's plight looks bad for the instant, and would have been disastrous had not one of the Indians, who had always shown a weakness for Nellie, handicapped Bill. This enabled the girls, who mounted the one horse, to get a lead. However, Bill and his red devils are fast gaining on them, and several of his bullets have taken effect in poor Nellie's body, who has sacrificially placed herself between the mountain girl and Bill. The girl's apprehension seems inevitable, when the Indian rides up, and Bill, with a dagger wound in the breast, falls from his horse, thereby closing his contemptible career. This in a measure demoralizes the gang, and the girls reach the mountaineer's cabin, but Nellie is mortally wounded and expires as she is taken from the horse, the good Indian driving up just in time to claim her body that he might bury it. This subject is an exceptionally thrilling one, with photography of the highest order, and many of the scenes tinted.::Moving Picture World synopsis

The Grand Daimio has long loved the pretty O Yama and presents himself before her mother in quest of her hand. His offer is scorned by O Yama, for she loves another, a low-born but worthy warrior. She writes to him to meet her by the Great Lamp of Savatiya that night, and they are nearly caught through the treachery of one of the butterflies of the court, who tells the Daimio of his rival. The lover escapes by hiding in the great lamp and afterwards being conveyed in a large hamper to the Bower of Roses, where he is eventually captured and thrown into the torture chamber. The Daimio, to render his revenge more complete, conveys to O Yama a false message from her lover, with his, the Daimio's, permission to see him. She is conducted to the chamber, and the sight that greets her fairly paralyzes her; for here is her lover hung by the wrists, dangling over a treacherous bed of upturned knife-blades, which inflict ugly wounds at the slightest move of his body. Besides this, there is a sword lying across a fire to be used at order from the Daimio. Here the Daimio gives poor O Yama her choice between her marriage with him or her lover's torture. But the brave warrior urges her to refuse. The sword, now incandescently hot, is applied to his breast, leaving great red scars, but he is still obdurate, until at length he is cut down and expires in the arms of O Yama. As he fails, his dagger drops to the floor, and O Yama, unobserved, conceals it in her obi. Then, turning to the Daimio, she consents to become his bride. He, delighted by her apparent change of heart, orders the preparations for the wedding to be made at once, which, according to Japanese custom, is to take place just before sundown. There in the wedding hall are assembled the courtiers and butterflies, when enter the priest, or ""Marrier,"" as he is called, followed by O Yama, her mother and the Daimio. The Daimio, his bride-elect, and her mother take their places on the cushions, while the Marrier pours the sake, handing the cup first to the mother, then to the Daimio, who both drink of the wine, and finally to O Yama, who, instead of drinking, whips the dagger from her obi, plunges it deep into the heart of the Daimio, who drops like a log, dead at her feet, and before anyone can intervene she performs the happy dispatch with the same bodkin, so concluding a film story that is not only a most exciting and novel one, but extremely picturesque as well.::Moving Picture World synopsis"

John is a clergyman and a noble, upright fellow, while Tom is a scapegrace, wild, reckless and unscrupulous. Not having the parental guidance so essential in youth, his father being dead and his mother blind, he drifted into bad company, the contaminating influence deeply affecting his susceptible nature. Despite the earnest pleading of his brother John he sank lower in morass of transgression, spending most of his time at the ale house drinking and at cards. All this John has succeeded in keeping from his dear mother, whose blindness is almost a blessing, for a mother would rather her eyes be sightless than to view the indiscretions of her loved ones. So she possessed the blissful impression that her boys were both paragons of righteousness. God's mercy is unfailing; you will admit this Divine Charity. In the village there dwelt, as neighbors to Wilkins, Farmer Tobias and his wife, and their daughter, Gladys.

273;The Reckoning;1908;D.W. Griffith;7.9;Drama Short;"We find a couple struggling for a livelihood, meager though it needs must be. The husband seemed content in the struggle, working at the factory for the pittance he received, but his love for his wife made the labor light. On the other hand, to the young wife this condition was most odious. In the grind of household duties, having, from force of circumstances, to do them all unassisted, she was like a flower withering for want of sunshine. Hence it was not surprising that she listened avidiously to the flattering platitudes of the unconscionable tempter. In the first scene we see her at the ironing table, while her husband bids her a tender adieu on his departure for work. Hardly has he left the threshold, when the grocer's clerk enters, and is received with an effusiveness most unplatonic. They at once proceed to enjoy a little lunch, the ingredients of which the clerk has brought in a basket. Meanwhile the husband arrives at the factory, only to find it closed down. Retracing his steps he arrives home, and seeing the window down and the shade closed, his suspicions are aroused. Stealthily raising the window and lifting the shade slightly, his fears are confirmed. His action, quiet though it be, startles the lovers, who leave the lunch table and hide behind a sheet hanging across the room. Entering, the husband, with gaze riveted on the sheet, picks up a pistol and sits himself in front of their hiding place, calmly lights his pipe and waits. At length he beckons, ""Come out.""

Kate is shown to a room, and is soon asleep with the bag of yellow nuggets reposing under her pillow. Suddenly the face of the Mexican woman is seen at the window, and she has little trouble in forcing it open. Her intrusion awakens Kate, but she overpowers her and gains the gold in the struggle. Kate manages to fire her revolver, with a view to bring aid, but all too late, for the thief makes good her escape, leaving behind on the door an incriminating mantilla, which discovers the identity of the culprit. A chase is made after the fugitive, the hotel clerk, friend of Kate's, leading the way. This poor fellow, however, is dropped in his tracks by a bullet from the woman's gun in ambush. Distancing her pursuers, the Mexican woman comes upon an Indian girl, who, with her half-breed husband, are camped alongside the river. The Red Girl bides the Mexican woman and throws the searching posse on the wrong trail. In return for the kindly act on the part of the Red Girl, the Mexican woman plies her wiles on the half-breed husband, not only taking him away, but inducing him to kill his wife. To this end they plan a torture. Binding her hands and feet, they take her to a large trunk of a dead tree, which overhangs the river, and here they hang her, like Tantalus, suspended between water and sky. With her teeth she manages to free one of her hands and with an ornament on her necklace contrives to saw the rope and drop into the water. Swimming to the shore she again meets Kate and her friends, and volunteers to become their guide in running down the miscreants, who have embarked in a canoe and are rapidly paddling down the river. Into another canoe the pursuers leap and are soon shortening the distance between themselves and the scoundrels, until at length they come up with them, and a hand-to-hand conflict ensues, during which both canoes are capsized, and a terrific struggle in the water ends with the overpowering of the pair and arrest of the Mexican Jezebel. The dip in the river has evidently chilled the half-breed's ardor for the Mexican woman, for he tries to return to the Red Girl, but she repulses him, and we leave her and Kate standing on the cliff, enfolded in each other's arms, bathed in the golden rays of a setting sun. Indeed a most beautiful scene.::Moving Picture World synopsis
275;The Red Man and the Child;1908;D.W. Griffith;6.0;Western Short Action;Alongside of a beautiful mountain stream in the foothills of Colorado there camped a Sioux Indian, who besides being a magnificent type of the aboriginal American, is a most noble creature, as kind-hearted as a woman and as brave as a lion. He eked his existence by fishing, hunting and mining, having a small claim which he clandestinely worked, hiding his gains in the trunk of an old tree. It is needless to say that he was beloved by those few who knew him, among whom was a little boy, who was his almost constant companion. One day he took the little fellow to his deposit vault, the tree trunk, and showed him the yellow nuggets he had dug from the earth, presenting him with a couple of them. In the camp there were a couple of low-down human coyotes, who would rather steal than work. They had long been anxious to find the hiding place of the Indian's wealth, so capture the boy, and by beating and torture compel him to disclose its whereabouts. In the meantime there has come to the place a couple of surveyors who enlist the services of the Indian to guide them to the hilltop. Here they arrive, set up their telescope and start calculations. An idea strikes them to allow the Indian to look through the 'scope. He is amazed at the view, so close does it bring the surrounding country to him. While his eye is at the glass one of the surveyors slowly turns it on the revolving head until the Indian starts back with an expression of horror, then looks again, and with a cry of anguish dashes madly away down the mountain side, for the view was enough to freeze the blood in his veins. Arriving at the old tree trunk, his view through the telescope is verified, for there is the result he improvised bank rifled, and the old grandfather of the little boy, who had followed the miscreants murdered. Picking the old man up he carries his lifeless form back to the camp, reaching there just after the murderers, with the boy, had decamped in a canoe. Laying the body on the sands and covering it tenderly with his shawl he stands over it and solemnly vows to be avenged. What a magnificent picture he strikes as he stands there, his tawny skin silhouetted against the sky, with muscles turgid and jaws set in grim determination. It is but for a moment he stands thus, yet the pose speaks volumes. Turning quickly, he leaps into a canoe at the bank and paddles swiftly after the fugitives. On, on goes the chase, the Indian gaining steadily on them, until at last abandoning hope, they leave their canoe and try to wade to shore as the Indian comes up. Leaping from his boat he makes for the pair, seizing one as the other swims to the opposite shore. Clutching him by the throat the Indian forces his head beneath the surface of the water and holds it there until life is extinct, after which he dashes in pursuit of the other. This proves to be a most exciting swimming race for a life. They reach the other shore almost simultaneously, and a ferocious conflict takes place on the sands terminating in the Indian forcing his adversary to slay himself with his own dagger. Having now fulfilled his vow he leaps into the water and swims back to the canoe in which sits the terrified boy, and as night falls he paddles slowly back to camp.::Moving Picture World synopsis

The melodramatic plot involves the conflict between generations in an immigrant Jewish family.::National Center for Jewish Film Ruth Simonson, with her father, is seen kneeling at the bedside of her mother, whose sands of life are rapidly ebbing. Realizing her end near, Mrs. Simonson takes from her neck a chain and locket and places it around the neck of her daughter, Ruth, with the prayerful injunction that she be ever guided in the path of prudence and virtue by this memorial. Commending her to the care of her father, the old lady goes to meet her Master in the Great Beyond. Two years later we find Ruth assisting her old father in his pawnshop. Mr. Simonson, although a money-lender, is benevolent in nature and his many deeds of munificence have endeared him to all who know him. Hence, when the local schatchen appears with Jacob Rubenstein, a wealthy suitor for his daughter's hand, it was his desire for her future happiness that induced him to look with favor on him. Ruth, however, had given her heart to Sol Bimberg, an impecunious bookseller in the neighborhood. While Mr. Simonson has no aversion for Sol, still to wed his daughter is out of the question, as his prospects are very poor. Ruth is determined, and when it comes to choosing between her father and her lover, she accepts the latter. Seven years later the little family, increased by a child, are living happily, when a fall from a ladder causes the death of Sol. Ruth, finding business cares too much for her, is forced to sell out to Rubenstein. The pittance realized from the sale does not last long, and poor Ruth is stricken down with the dread disease that carried off her mother. Reduced to poverty, she is forced to send the little girl to the pawnshop with the locket, on which to raise enough to buy a bit of bread. At the pawnshop, old Simonson recognizes the locket, and his heart at once softens, so he goes with the child to the garret, where he arrives just in time to reconcile his lost one when she breathes her last. Crushed and heartbroken, the old man folds her child, his granddaughter, to his breast, which forms the closing scene of a most touching and heart-stirring film. Several of the scenes arc decidedly interesting in the fact that they were actually taken in the thickly settled Hebrew quarters of New York City.::Moving Picture World synopsis A pawn shop.

283;The Stolen Jewels;1908;D.W. Griffith;6.8;Drama Short;It would have taken more than the wonderful powers of deduction of a Sherlock Holmes to have dispelled the mystery that shrouded the disappearance of a case of jewels at the home of Robert Jenkins, a wealthy stockbroker, and although they were eventually brought to light, it was through a most remarkable accident. Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins are getting ready for an evening at the opera, and. as usual Mrs. Jenkins is tantalizingly slow in her preparations, and is almost carried out of the house by the impatient Jenkins. Baby Jenkins is very much in evidence, and requires a bribe to induce her to remain contented with the maid. This Mrs. J. furnishes in the shape of a papier-maché doggie, the head of which is removed to find its interior filled with candy. Mrs. Jenkins is inclined to deck herself out in her diamonds, and takes the case from the strong-box, but in her anxiety to appease her husband's flustering, she hurriedly kisses baby and departs, forgetting all about the jewels. They are not long in the theater before the thought of the diamonds comes to her, and the awful possible result of her carelessness. She will not rest until Mr. Jenkins takes her home. On arriving there, sure enough her worst fears are apparently confirmed. There on the desk lies the jewel case empty. Good heavens! what's to be done? No one was in the house but the baby and nurse, both of whom are now abed. There is no trace or sign of the entrance of a thief. How did it happen? Well, the detectives are summoned and put to work on the case, but without success, although a reward of $10,000 is offered for the apprehension of the robbers and return of the jewels. The detectives finally give the matter up. Poor Jenkins is certainly up against it, for the loss of the jewels is the beginning of a streak of wretched luck. He is beaten on all sides in the stock market until at length he is forced to the wall. Poverty, disgrace and even starvation stare him and his loved ones in the face. Forced to sell his house and then the furniture to satisfy his creditors, he is in the depths of despair as he stands and views his precious little one playing on the floor with her doggie, unconscious of the anguish of her father. Piece by piece the household effects are seized, until there remains but a couple of chairs, on one of which Baby places her doggie. At that moment the door opens and Smithson, Jenkins' friend, enters to offer his sympathy and aid. Smithson is a good hearted, blustering fellow, and in the enthusiasm of his friendship, flusters about, finally throwing himself into the only chair in the room, not noticing the toy, of course crushing it to atoms. Leaping to his feet, he is profuse in apologies, when, lo and behold! there among the fragments of the broken dog lay the diamonds. The clouds that hung over the household are dissipated and the little family may start anew. There are many sensational incidents in the course of the film, one showing the curb market of New York is most unique.::Moving Picture World synopsis
284;Knight of Black Art;1908;Georges Méliès;5.2;Short;"We are introduced to the banqueting hall of an old-time castle. Servitors stand awaiting the arrival of their master, who, appearing on the scene, throws his cloak to an attendant; unbuckling his sword, he hands him that also, then at the word of command the attendant throws them upward and they vanish. The knight then takes two large rings, a sheet of paper, which he places on one of the rings, then fitting the other over the paper draws it taut as a drum. Two attendants then hold the paper-covered rings upright, another hands a paint brush and paint to the knight, who proceeds to draw a face on the paper. This at a sign changes into a laughing, roguish character. The knight then plunges his arms through the eyes of the figure and draws therefrom bottles of wine which he hands to an attendant who surreptitiously drinks their contents. Making an incision where the mouth is drawn, our knight takes therefrom shawls, scarves and wraps of the finest texture. Taking the rings from the attendants, he turns it about to show there is nothing further therein, he hands it back and again draws this time four magnificent ladies' costumes, which he hands to his helper, He now takes the rings from the two pages and rolling them off the scene stands the boys in center of the hall, fuming them round he produces two other pages from them, then throwing the costumes to the four, who donning them are changed into four ladies who go through a graceful dance. Taking off the dresses, they change again to pages; the four become two and vanish from view. The knight takes a ring, ties four ropes to it, and, suspending it in mid-air, calls a page, who sits under it. Then from the ring there gradually ascends a fairy form, who at a sign again descends. The knight next causes a pedestal to appear, standing thereon he holds aloft one of the rings, which gradually lowers itself on the knight who disappears; appearing from another side, he takes the two rings, placing them edge to edge they form a cycle, which the knight mounts and rides away.::Moving Picture World synopsis"

She was indeed the fairest flower that e'er blossomed in the land of the golden sun. At this tavern there stopped the honest, hardy miners and trappers of the neighboring country on their way to and from their claims in the mountains. A sort of a rest-up place for a chat and a smoke with the old keeper, and a mug of ale, served by the fair hands of his daughter. Among those who frequented this rustic hostelry was one of those proletarian half-breed Mexicans, whose acidulate countenance was most odious to all, particularly the girl. On the other hand, her blue eyes, golden hair and sunny complexion inflamed him so as to make bold to kiss her. He is indignantly repulsed, receiving a blow on the face from the girl which sends him from the place, scowling and towering with rage. It is nightfall and the guests all having departed, the keeper leaves for a short jaunt up the road, warning the girl to be sure to lock up during his absence, which she does: then going to her room to prepare for her well-earned rest. She has just removed her waist when there is a knock at the door, and, thinking it is her father returning, she throws a mantilla over her shoulders and opens the door to the Mexican, who had seen her father depart. The cruel, black nature of the brute now asserts itself, and barring the door, he seizes the helpless girl, who screams and struggles until her father, bursting in, engages the half-breed in a fierce conflict, while the girl rushes out into the night. The Mexican having with a blow stunned the father, follows after her. Next we see the poor frail creature dashing wildly and almost aimlessly through the thick forest, coming at last, as morning breaks, to the cabin of her nearest neighbor.

Hearing the Mexican's approach, the girl hides behind a curtain. In rushes the infuriated beast in search of his prey. While rummaging the place, he is attracted by the childish prattle of the miner's baby, who sits in its cradle playing with her dollie.

This letter, purporting to be from his attorney, tells that he has been reduced to bankruptcy by the failure of his agents. Aha! Now we see who his friends are. He was all right while he had it, but now it is different, and they all leave him to his apparent fate, ""So this is what they call friendship. Well, it is as false as sin. But there is true friendship to be found, and I'll find it."" So saying, he leaves behind his life of ease and enlists in the army of the low born. Securing a position as porter in a factory, he sees the other side of life: how those poor devils have to struggle for a livelihood, and yet how honest and open-hearted. None of that cringing deceit of his own set. At the factory there are employed a number of girls. Jennie Coleman, one of the prettiest, is offered an insult by the overseer, and Ross knocks him down for the affront. Jennie's heart went out at once to her protector, and from that time on they were friends, yes, friends, for true friendship is love refined, and purged from all its dross. They were often seen together, and little did Jennie dream of the real being of the man she put her trust in. It was not long before the arduous duties of the factory told on Ross, and he was at last thrown on his back by severe illness. In a poorly furnished room he lies, without those necessities so essential to his recovery. Here he is visited by faithful Jennie, who, finding him without food and other comforts, and penniless, she leaves him and repairs to a hairdressing establishment where she sells her wealth of blond hair, her crown of beauty of which she was pardonably proud, and with the proceeds purchases food and medicine. When Ross sees the terrible sacrifice the girl has made he deeply regrets going so far, and prays for life and strength to return materially this friendship. He is granted his wish, for they are married, and at the conclusion of the ceremony she is transported into what to her seems fairyland, clothed in gorgeous raiment and bedecked with jewels, with lackeys and servants in attendance.

Alfred rushes in, seizes the unconscious girl in his arms and plunges out again through the flames. At the gate he comes upon Olaf and his followers, and places the daughter in her father's arms. She quickly revives, smiles in her father's face, and turns to her rescuer, who reverently kisses the hand held out to him. Again Theckla pleads with her parent, who grants his daughter's wish, and gives a command to one of his soldiers, who comes forward and gives a sword and helmet to Alfred, hails him as a hero and grants him his freedom. Then Olaf takes his daughter by one hand and her rescuer by the other, joins their hands and raises his own in blessing.::Moving Picture World synopsis"

Tearing himself from the grave of his little girl he arms himself with his assegai and oxhide shield and is soon at the head of his band of savages, with sinister designs on the Boers. The Boers themselves have become active, and scouts have been sent out to warn those nomadic South Africans who might be on the road. One family, comprising a Boer, his wife and a four-year-old girl, are, however, trapped, and despite extreme measures to elude the merciless black brutes, are soon overtaken. Finding escape hopeless, the Boer leaps from his wagon, and sending his wife and child into the woods, seizes his rifle, in the vain hope of holding the savages at bay while the woman and child seek a place of safety. There is a shower of assegais, one of which pierces the poor fellow, dropping him into the road. Up rush the prancing, jibbing, gibbering barbarians. Finding the man dead, they rush on to find the others. The distracted woman hides the girl in a niche in the rooks, while she goes to find some avenue of escape, but she is at once apprehended and taken by the band to their camp, their chief remaining behind. The baby now comes forward to appeal to the Zulu, who is so reminded by her of his own lost treasure that his cruel nature at once softens as the little one offers her dollie as ransom for her mother. The chief is so moved that he vows to save the mother's life, if it costs him his own. Placing the little one in a crevice in the rocks, where she soon falls asleep, he goes to find the mother. Arriving at the camp, he demands the release of the woman, which his followers grant with protests. Back he goes to get the child, but the wily devils have anticipated him and carried her off. He soon overtakes them, however, and after slaying three in a terrific conflict, delivers the child to its mother, and then sees them safely to their destination. The subject is a beautiful story of parental affection, portrayed in a most novel manner, besides being intensely thrilling.::Moving Picture World synopsis

In this Hindu pantheon there gathered natives of the Ganges Valley of all castes, with the priests, their wives, and houris; also a generous sprinkling of Western tourists, they being drawn thither by their thirst for sight-seeing. Most kaleidoscopic was the scene as out of its midst towered the stately idol Brahma. In the forehead of the idol there was embedded a mammoth diamond of fabulous value. This was termed the ""Light of the World."" Among the tourists there is one who, a stranger in a strange land, finds himself in a depleted condition as regards finances. Extravagant and improvident, he is piling up a bill at the Cawnpore Hotel without funds to meet it. The sight of this diamond at once arouses his cupidity and he determines to secure it at any hazard. A visit to the temple shows that the Brahma is attended by one veiled guard. He also learns that this guard has a sweetheart who visits him during his lonely vigil. Enlisting the services of an unscrupulous Hindu they follow the girl to her home where they force her and her father to go with them to the temple, where under threat of her father's murder she gives drugged wine to her lover, the guard.

The guard at once recognizes him as the tourist who had visited the temple, and sets out to find him, which he does at the hotel, just after the tourist has sewed the diamond up in the handle of his suit case. He contrives to engage himself as a servant and as such makes a fruitless search of the tourist's effects, He is on the point of despairing when the tourist is called upon by a diamond merchant. Effecting his presence in the room by hypnotic power, the guard manages to secure the diamond and dashing madly back to the dungeon arrives just in time to stay the uplifted scimitar from the neck of the faithful girl.::Moving Picture World synopsis"

She succeeds in persuading him from his reckless life, and he determines to cut off from his old loose companions by going out West and making a man of himself.

How many of us are wont to look back and wish that we might blot out from our memory the ever recurring specter of the follies of our youth. Such was the experience of Henry J. Newman, a wealthy banker, who, in the flippant Spring of his life was guilty of a slight indiscretion which now in the sober Autumn of his existence seems so iniquitous that he fain would forget it, and above all keep it from knowledge of his family, not that it was enormous, for it was not, as Newman was a man whose standard of morals was high. However, this one false step was known of by Dick Folson, an unconscionable wretch, who, knowing Newman's sensitive nature, sees in the episode an elegant chance for graft, or rather blackmail, which he proceeds to take advantage of. He writes a letter to Newman telling him he has convincing proof of the affair and asking if it is worth to him $300 a month to keep mum. If not Mrs. Newman will be apprised of all. The letter arrives at a most opportune time to lend success to Folson's design, for Newman is surrounded by his little family, enjoying to the extreme mellifluous domesticity. He goes to his office and sends an answer to Folson saying that his demand is unreasonable and begging him to have pity. Folson writes an answer, but on second thought goes to Newman's office himself and to Newman's entreaties simply replies that it is either $300 a month, the first payment at once, or he will expose him to his wife. Newman at length yields and Folson goes away satisfied for the month at least. The money does not last long under the strain of Folson's dissipations and a week later finds him broke again.

313;A Corner in Wheat;1909;D.W. Griffith;6.7;Short Crime Drama;"An unscrupulous and greedy capitalist speculator decides to corner the wheat market for his own profit, establishing complete control over the markets.::Nick Riganas A greedy tycoon decides, on a whim, to corner the world market in wheat. This doubles the price of bread, forcing the grain's producers into charity lines and further into poverty. The film continues to contrast the ironic differences between the lives of those who work to grow the wheat and the life of the man who dabbles in its sale for profit.::James Meek <james@oz.net> No subject has ever been produced more timely than this powerful story of the wheat gambler, coming as it does when agitation is rife against that terrible practice of cornering commodities that are the necessities of life. Laws are being framed with a view of suppressing such nefarious transactions, and no more convincing argument could be shown than that set forth in this picture. Every phase of the question is illumined, beginning with an animated reproduction of Jean Francois Millet's masterpiece, ""The Sowers."" From the barn they start and with the grain sack hung from their shoulders, the two bent and knotted forms are seen trudging wearily over the plowed ground, their arms swinging in perfect chronometry with a slight gush of wheat grain pouring forth at each advance of the arm. In this scene we find the genesis of one of the mammoth industries of the earth. The foundation of life, for it is the foundation of the bread of life. How little do those poor honest souls realize the turmoil the fruit of their labors will incur. What a contrast is shown in the office of the Wheat King, surrounded by his lieutenants, waiting for the word as he engineers the great corner whereby he will obtain absolute control of the entire produce, not only of the present, but the future toiling of the poor sowers. Into the wheat pit on the ""'Change"" we go, and there find a struggling mob of brokers with their all slowly but surely melting under the blast of the King's determination. At length the battle is won, and the Wheat King stands majestically amid the debris of wrecked fortunes. Here is the gold of the wheat. He is lauded for his acumen, wined and dined and regarded as a man among men, little thinking of the misery and suffering his so-called genius has induced. Ah! that is the chaff of the wheat. The baker is obliged to pay twice as much as formerly for his flour and so must charge twice as much for the loaf. Consequently, many a poor soul must go hungry. Furthermore, the bread fund for the poor is cut down, and many a shivering wretch stands in the line only to be denied bread when his turn comes. There is no vengeance possible here but the hand of God, and God's vengeance when wreaked is terrible and unconditional, and one of the sins that cries to heaven for vengeance is denying food to the hungry. This cry is heard, and as the King is showing his friends through the elevators into the bins of which are flowing the steady stream of his golden grain, he trips and falls into one of the bins and is buried. He has been called before his God to answer. Our thoughts are carried back to the bent and knotted forms of the sowers trudging along, ignorant of the vengeance of the wheat.::Moving Picture World synopsis As an unscrupulous and greedy capitalist speculator decides to corner the wheat market for his own profit, at the same time, the price of flour and bread double their price, establishing complete control over the markets for the king of wheat. Inevitably, the already poor farmers are forced to return home empty-handed, as the urban citizens who can no longer afford to buy bread, beg for a slice. Will this injustice end?::Nick Riganas The ""king of wheat"" is grinding the monopoly on wheat. On one side they face inflated prices while on the other side the farmers do not have the money for bread.

While so engaged a poor woman of the village hurries to his home to enlist his services for her little girl, who she fears is at the point of death. Oh, God! what a situation. His own child needing his undivided attention most urgently, on the one hand, and duty on the other. Duty, that relentless deity of the honorable which so often compels self-sacrifice, beckons him on. Irresolute for a moment, he at length goes, assuring his wife that be will be but a few minutes away. Arriving at the humble cabin of the woman, he finds her child very ill indeed, requiring speedy and unerring attention to save her. Meanwhile, Edith, his own child, has grown worse, and the mother has dispatched the maid to hurry him back home. When the maid arrives and tells him the conditions, he for a moment wavers, but then his duty seems clear to him. If he leaves the poor woman's child, death is inevitable, so he dismisses the maid with the word that it will be only a few minutes longer and then he will return. Little Edith sinks rapidly, so the maid is again sent. This time he is about to leave, as the child is out of danger and will recover. So he leaves the poor family, happy and relieved, to rush madly to his own home. What a contrast! There across the lifeless form of his dear child lies his moaning, horror-stricken wife. A slave of duty, he yields the life of his own dear child to save the life of another's. The valley of Stillwater is shrouded in darkness. Such are the temporal deeds that will find reward eternal.::Moving Picture World synopsis

Here is shown a most clever piece of motion picture producing, portraying the downward path of the young man who was induced to take his first drink: how it finally became an unconquerable habit, causing poverty and suffering for his wife and child and death for himself, while.at the same time presenting a sermon to Wharton in front, sinking deeper and deeper into his heart, until at the final curtain he is a changed man, going homeward with a firm determination that he will drink no more, which he promises his wife upon his return. Two years later we find the little family seated, happy and peaceful, at their fireside and we know that the promise has been kept.::Moving Picture World synopsis"
326;The Eavesdropper;1909;D.W. Griffith;5.7;Short Drama;Hidalgo offers his daughter's hand in marriage when he can't repay a loan to Manuella. But when Manuella overhears the daughter bidding farewell to her lover, he is so moved by their devotion that he cancels the debt.::Anonymous The inevitable result of eavesdropping is at best a pseudo-gratification, for the listener rarely hears anything of a pleasant nature. An old Spanish Hidalgo becomes deeply involved in financial reverses and Manuella, a wealthy ranchero, helps him out. However, things have gone from bad to worse, and the old man finds himself at the mercy of Manuella, who, while not of the Draconian nature, of course expects his money or the security. He calls to apprise the old man that his notes are overdue, and insists upon a settlement, which the poor old fellow is unable to do. While there he meets Mercedes, the old man's beautiful daughter, and falls deeply in love with her, and offers to cancel the obligations for the daughter's hand in marriage. Now Mercedes is enamored of Carlos, a poor peon of the village, whom she loves in return and when the suggestion of the ranchero is broached she indignantly repulses it. However, upon realizing her poor father's condition she decides to make the sacrifice and consents. She then bids Carlos call to see her to break the unpleasant intelligence to him and part company. The lover calls and is almost heartbroken when Mercedes tells him the sad news. While they are engaged in the act of separating, the ranchero enters the adjoining room and through the half open door hears the sorrowful word of the last farewell between the young couple. He is so touched by the pure, self-sacrificing love of the lovers, that he softens and feels he is worthy of bitter reproach for being the instrument of tearing asunder two trusting hearts such as these, so he makes up his mind that such shall not be. He then enters the room, and bidding the young ones to be of good heart, he not only joins their hands in bonds of true love, but makes them a present of the promissory notes which he had threateningly held over her father's head but a few moments before. This is one case of where eavesdropping was attended by ecstatic results.::Moving Picture World synopsis
327;Edgar Allan Poe;1909;D.W. Griffith;6.1;Short Biography Drama;"The story, while not biographical, is founded on incidents in his life, showing his devotion for his sick wife, Virginia. Desperate from his utter helplessness to ameliorate his dying wife's suffering, owing to extreme destitution, he is in a frenzy of grief, when a raven is seen to perch on a bust of Pallas above the door of their cold, cheerless apartment. An inspiration! He sets to work, and that masterpiece. ""The Raven,"" is the fruit. During his work he has divested himself of his coat, putting it over his wife to protect her from the cold. The poem finished, he rushes coatless and hatless to the publisher, where he meets with scant attention. One editor, however, thinks the work possesses some merit and offers ten dollars for it. Ten dollars for the greatest jewel in the diadem of fame - think of it! Poe thinks of the comforts, meager though they needs must be, for his poor wife and accepts the offer. Hastening to the store, he procures food, a heavy comfortable for the cot, and medicine, and with much lighter heart returns home. Spreading the quilt tenderly over Virginia, he takes her hand and gazes fondly into her sightless eyes, but the cold, unresponsive hand tells him the awful truth.

That Harry and Margie deeply loved each other is most apparent; that Dad had a strong aversion for Harry as a son-in-law is also apparent, and when he finds them in clandestine conference there is something doing. Harry is chased about the room by Dad with a cane, which in a wild sweep at Harry goes through a pier mirror. Oh, the woe of it. This might be considered ominous, and it was for Dad, but it was the omen of good fortune for the lovers. As an extreme measure Dad decides to send Margie to Europe with his sister, her aunty, to be out of reach of Harry. Bright scheme, you would say. Well Aunty's vanity was the undoing. She insists on a new and elaborate gown, so Dad gives her the money to buy it. Harry learns of this and follows Aunty to the store and buys an exact duplicate of her traveling outfit. Attired in it he visits Margie's home. Upon entering he is almost confronted by Aunty similarly attired. To hide he dodges behind the mirror, and oh horror, the broken glass has been removed. Here is a predicament. Aunty is approaching. Ah! an idea. Harry stands his ground and when Aunty comes to the mirror, she also not knowing it has been removed, he mimics her antics to a nicety, so she imagines him a reflex, and so exits perfectly satisfied with herself. Dad then appears and shoving a roll of bills into masquerading Harry's hand, sends him off with Margie for Europe (?), but instead they go to the minister's.::Moving Picture World synopsis"

Of course Aunty comes, and is accompanied by the Rev. Joshua Whittington, the gentleman who has done the deed for the young couple. No sooner have they set foot on the place than the trouble begins. First of all, Aunty and the reverend gentleman object strenuously to the candied affection indulged in by the young couple. Then they proceed to run things to their own Ideas. The cook does not furnish the table to suit them, so there is trouble in the kitchen; the servants are not alert enough, so they fall in for a share of the interlopers' despotism: and soon the household is in a tumult verging upon insurrection. At last a shaft of light breaks in upon the dark and stormy aspect in the person of Bill Corker, an old college chum of Tom's, who is the comedian of a show playing in the town, and he calls. Hearing the tale of woe of his friends, he volunteers to help them out. Well, talk about a ""monkey and parrot"" time: Bill plays the leading role in the funniest comedy he has ever done in the whole course of his histrionic career. Many things are pulled, but the climax comes when Bill, in a fire-eating cowboy makeup, chases the odious visitors out of the house, down the road to the railroad station, where they both leap on a moving train which carries them cityward, presumably thanking a benevolent Providence that they have escaped with their lives, no doubt to ejaculate whenever Norton Villa is mentioned, ""Never again.""

Trevor's kindly nature has impressed Mrs. Waterbury, and there is a slight suggestion that they love, but both being the souls of honor, hide it from each other. However, Trevor, appreciating the fact that Mrs. Waterbury is wedded to a hopeless drunkard, feels half-inclined to declare his love for the suffering woman, and persuade her to leave Waterbury. But, no. He reasons such a step would not be honorable, so he decides to go away to avoid a wrong. Hence, he plans to go to the far West. He cannot leave without saying good-bye, and repairs to their home with this intention only. Waterbury from the next room, whither he has gone surreptitiously to drink, witnesses their parting and misconstrues the intent of the meeting deeming it an intrigue. Trevor leaves for the west and Mrs. Waterbury retires to her room. Waterbury enters and seizing a revolver is at first in mind to satisfy his jealous rage: hut on second thought he feels that he himself is to blame, and the weapon he would use on them should more justifiably be turned on himself. This decides him, and he writes the following: ""My Dear Helen, I realize my weakness is incurable. I am your curse. Will be so no longer. You and Trevor love. My last toast. To you both.""

However, the poor woman has vowed to lead a penitential life, and no persuasion can induce her to change her determination, so Trevor must bow to the inevitable, and leaves. The subject is rather out of the ordinary, and being beautifully staged and acted, will prove intensely interesting.::Moving Picture World synopsis"

332;A Fair Exchange;1909;D.W. Griffith;5.3;Short Drama;"Free adaptation of George Eliot's ""Silas Marner."" This Biograph adaptation makes Master Marner a cobbler instead of a linen weaver, but this change does not weaken, nor make less romantic, the story. Silas is first seen in the act of ministering to his dying friend, and while engaged in this act of mercy. William Dane enters stealthily and steals the dying man's money, leaving Marner's handkerchief alongside the dresser so as to throw the blame on him. The money is discovered missing, and. of course, circumstantial evidence points conclusively to Marner, who protests innocence, and is given a chance of vindicating himself through that old superstitious practice of visiting the church and in presence of the elders in the vestry kneels and prays and draws lots. Fate is against him, and he draws the black card which declares him guilty. This is final, and his friends shun him as they would a leper. He makes good the stolen money out of his own hard-earned savings, and leaves his native village for another section of the country. Here he pursues his vocation of shoemaking. His trouble has made him a misanthrope and miser, niggardly hoarding the gains of his toil, guarding it with a jealousy induced by despicable money lust. A confirmed recluse, he spurns the advances of all: beggars are driven away empty-handed, with vituperation; in fact, the strain of charity hitherto dominant in his nature is effaced. His one thought is his golden coins; his only pleasure is the musical clink as they fall from his hands in counting them, afterwards biding them in the wall by removing a stone and placing them behind it. One day this is observed by a couple of thieves who peer through his window. Awaiting an opportunity, they enter during his absence and seize the money, making off with it. When Silas re-enters he sets about indulging in his only diversion, but what a revelation! The money is gone. Like a maniac he dashes out in search of the thieves, but without success, returning and dropping on his workbench in utter despair. Meanwhile, a poor, deserted mother of the parish, with her little child, wanders from her home in quest of her perfidious husband, only to die on the road. The child, alone, continues on the way, and entering Marner's hovel, sinks exhausted on the hearthstone. Silas arouses from his lethargy and is amazed to find the little baby, which toddles to his arms. What a change comes over him! Folding the little one to his breast, he exclaims, ""This shall be my recompense."" Indeed a fair exchange. That moment his flinty heart softens and he becomes benevolence personified.::Moving Picture World synopsis Silas Marner takes care of a dying friend while William Dane steals the dying man's money and leaves evidence to incriminate Silas.

Diversion of all sorts are brought, but without success, until at last they decide to abduct the pretty daughter of the fool and bring her to the Duke. This is effected, and when the Duke sees her he falls deeply in love with her, but her pure innocence instills in him a higher, holier devotion than he was accustomed to experience, so he harkens to her plea, and throwing his cloak about her, sees her safely home. This is witnessed by the fool, who is in hiding, and misjudging the Duke's attitude, vows vengeance. To this end he enlists the services of a nomad couple who are dwelling in a hut not far off. He bargains with them that to kill the man he shall point out he will pay them five hundred louis. The pact is made, and the Duke is pointed out to them by the fool as he strolls in the gardens with the girl. As the Duke leaves the girl she espies the trio skulking on the grounds and follows them to the hut, where she overhears the plan. She at once decides to save the Duke, but how? To tell him would incriminate her old father. Nothing seems feasible but self-sacrifice, which she bravely determines to do. Going to her house, she dons male attire and with the cloak the Duke had loaned her thrown over her shoulders she bids adieu to her home and life and like a soldier goes bravely unto death. Entering the hut, her face hidden, she receives the blow intended for another and dies before the horror-stricken gypsy couple, who discover their mistake. They, however, put her body in a sack, and when the fool appears, collect their promised fee and flee. The fool is now in a state of fiendish exultation over the seeming success of his vengeance, and after dancing gleefully around the sack, determines to make away with it, but upon picking it up is startled by the litheness of the form enclosed. Ripping open the sack, the sight that greets him fairly freezes his blood, for there lies his own daughter, cold in death, a victim of his own dastardly plot. This final scene is without doubt the most intense bit of work ever done in motion pictures.::Moving Picture World synopsis

From that evening on he becomes her abject slave to the neglect of his own devoted wife and child. Mrs. Edmonds tries hard to dissemble and keep her sorrow from the little one, but he too misses the society of papa, his little romps with him and his good-night kiss on going to bed, until at last he is constrained to write papa a note complaining of his neglect.

Jack learns of Robert's intention to elope with the other woman, and calls on her just after Robert has gone to get his suitcase preparatory to depart.

But at this very moment her arm is seized by the baron, who comes out from behind the curtain. The countess jumps to her feet, but when she sees that everything is out she falls back in a swoon. In a few words the baron explains what has happened. He calls the servants, who carry the countess out, and then he enters the ballroom again. With revolver in hand he makes the guests take off their masks, and now he points out the conspirators one by one. The policemen take them away, and the guests gather round the prince and baron with eager questions, but the prince answers smilingly: ""My dear guests, don't let this little incident disturb our pleasure; it was only an attempt on my life.""::Moving Picture World synopsis"

345;Hansel and Gretel;1909;J. Searle Dawley;4.4;Drama Short;"We are transported back to the little Dutch cottage in the woods and see little Hansel and Gretel and their parents, and we feel their hunger and are glad when their father starts out with the load of brooms, which they have just finished, to make some sales; and when we see the borrowed milk, which is to relieve their hunger until he returns, spilled on the floor and the children driven to the woods after berries, we know that fairies cannot be very far away and that something is going to happen. Soon we see the children wandering in the woods and beginning to be frightened as it grows late and strange, uncanny faces laugh at them from behind tree trunks and the rocks. We see them meet the sandman, who puts them to sleep and laughingly goes on his way, and then we are privileged to be the only ones who see what happens while they sleep. Suddenly the woods beyond them grow light with strange radiance and shining angels with their harps look down upon them and guard their slumbers; and when the night is done and the dawn approaches, we are the only ones who see the troops of fairies that discover them and awaken them with bells of flower cups and trumpets from the honeysuckle. But this is not all, for even though the day has dawned they are not out of danger. Soon we see the terrible old witch, who has finally found them, casting her spell over them and driving them, all unconscious of her presence, through the forest. We see her suddenly stop and hold up her hands and the marvelous house of gingerbread and frosting appears out of the thin air and takes shape before them! We see her put Hansel in a cage to be fattened that she may eat him later on, and then we see, but why tell the rest? Of course, the witch meets her deserts and everything ends happily both for Hansel and Gretel, and for the gingerbread children whom they bring back to life out of the witch's spell. The illusive and imaginative quality of the fairy tale has been fully preserved in this Edison production, and those who have read the story, or who have heard the opera, will find new interest in it and enjoy the original and logical denouement which comes as a surprise at the end.::Moving Picture World synopsis"

Years after we find the baby grown up to innocent girlhood. But the world has not been too kind to Luke, and it is a struggle for him to get along. On the other hand, James has prospered, but his success is only a means by which his conscience may all the more taunt him. His life is unhappy and he longs for his child.

She will not leave Luke, for she loves him as the only father she has ever known. James is denied even the love of his own child.

353;In Old Kentucky;1909;D.W. Griffith;6.6;Short Drama War;"A stirring episode of the Civil War. At the beginning of the Civil War, Kentucky attempted to hold a neutral position between the belligerents, and her sons decided for themselves which side's cause to take up; hence it was that many a Kentucky home was divided. The sentiment of the people seemed evenly balanced, and when old Mr. Wilkinson entered with the newspaper heralding the proclamation, ""War Is Declared,"" George, his youngest son, took up the Union flag, declaring his intention to fight under its stripes, calling to his brother Robert to do likewise. But Bob's heart is with the Confederates, and he declines to listen to his brother's reasoning and so goes to enlist in the Southern army. The old Kentucky home is divided; it is brother against brother. Later, Robert is selected as the bearer of sealed orders, and as he will probably have to pass the Union lines, he is attired in Union uniform. Starting on his perilous journey, he is soon dangerously near the Union outposts, where George is seen posting sentries. Robert is discovered while climbing up the side of the mountain, and fired on by George, who is ignorant of his identity. Fleeing for safety, he is followed and apprehended by the Union forces, when, for the first time, Robert and George meet.

While fording a stream, Robert by strategy manages to bolt, and outdistancing his pursuers, rushes into his old home for shelter.

He at once discerns where Robert is, and would have dragged him from his hiding, but his mother, with the pistol at her head, threatens to fire if he advances one step. In the face of this, George falters in his duty and leaves. Robert later escapes. Finally, the war over, George returns home 'neath triumphant banners, promoted in rank, and with the whole village assembled to greet him. The old home is the scene of great rejoicing.

The mother folds her lost boy to her heart, and George, with the Union flag thrown over his arm, stretches forth his hand to his brother, who, with the old, tattered colors of the Confederacy held affectionately to his breast, receives the warm grasp, typifying the motto of Kentucky, ""United we stand, divided we fall.""::Moving Picture World synopsis Brothers George and Robert enlist on opposite sides in the Civil War.

363;Lady Helen's Escapade;1909;D.W. Griffith;5.1;Short Comedy Drama;"Prizes gained without effort are never valuable, and, though we don't appreciate it, the longing for something makes existence sweet; hence if one has everything there is nothing to long for. Such was the condition of Lady Helen, who had everything she could wish for, and in consequence felt very much bored. In her ennui she longs for excitement, for some new sensation, but in vain, until looking over the newspaper she is seized with an irresistible inclination of going out to work, so incognito engages as a domestic in a boarding house. Here she makes a ludicrous attempt to cook, etc., and of course, being totally ignorant of the culinary art, meets with meagre success. However, her pretty face and ill-concealed refinement make such a strong impression upon the male contingent, that they make no complaints at her cooking, and would have taken even poison if served by her fair hands. Two hallroom boys are particularly smitten. Among the boarders there is a talented musician, and his gentle manners and wonderful talent appeal strongly to Lady Helen. He on the other hand, not knowing of course her true self, falls in love with her. All this is most agreeable to the women folks, who at once conspire to rid the place of her, which one brings about by having her accused of the theft of the musician's violin. He, of course, believes her innocent, but she is discharged nevertheless. Lady Helen is so moved by the poor fellow's kindness, that she interests herself in his behalf and secures for him a position as a director at the Conservatory, for which he calls to thank her and finding her a lady of quality would shrink humbly from her presence, but she will not let him for she too loves him. The subject as a whole is a decidedly amusing comedy drama, with a pretty love story running through it.::Moving Picture World synopsis A bored Lady Helen goes slumming as a domestic in a boarding house. There she falls in love with a sensitive young musician. The other women in the house are jealous, and accuse her of trying to steal the musician's violin.

Our story starts with the Colonel and his two nieces starting out to make a short cut to Fort George, accompanied by a scout and piloted by a trusted Indian guide, who was none other than Big Serpent. This traitorous redskin is elated at the opportunity to perpetrate a long cherished revenge. To this effect he has notified his followers and they stand in readiness to act at his call. Proceeding on their journey, they come to a mountain stream, where the party rest and take water, Big Serpent and the scout leading the horses into the shade of the wood. Just prior to the party's arrival, Leather Stocking and Uncas meet, and when they learn Big Serpent is guiding the party, they express their misgivings, being sure of his sinister intention, and truly, for while they are indicating their fears, the scout rushes on and tells that he had been assaulted and the horses killed. Leather Stocking and Uncas volunteer to see the party through their danger, if possible, but they have not proceeded far when the woods seem alive with Indians and the party is almost surrounded. Taking the only avenue of retreat, they manage to reach the stockade just ahead of the bloodthirsty Indians. Here a spirited battle ensues, which is not destined to last long, as ammunition is low. It is hoping against hope, for we now find there are but two charges left, and after that they will be at the mercy of the foe. Leather Stocking, however, feels that there is but one chance, hazardous though it be, of getting to the fort for aid. His plan is subtle in the extreme. Donning an animal's skin, he plunges into the swirly, tortuous river at the back of the stockade, knowing that the crafty Indians would waste no ammunition on game, but save it for the enemy, ammunition being a scarce and precious commodity. In this manner he succeeds in reaching the soldiers' quarters, where he falls, exhausted, after telling them of the danger of the party. The soldiers start off at once, and are none too soon, for in the meantime the Indians have effected an entrance into the stockade with battering rams and have the party tied up to trees, piling brush to incinerate them. The torch is already applied to the brush about Uncas, and only the timely arrival of the soldiers and annihilation of the redskins saves his life. Uncas then accompanies the party on their way to the brow of the bill, where we leave him standing alone, the last of the Mohicans.::Moving Picture World synopsis"

Will he still love her when his sight is restored?::Emily Way <emily@vex.net> Carl Wagner was bereft of his sight when a small child, and in order that he might be independent and earn a livelihood he learned music, that art in which the blind become most proficient. He played violin for the dancing at many of the East Side balls. Grace, Vivian and Daisy are sisters in a family of the workaday class. Vivian and Daisy are pretty young girls, while Grace is considered homely on account of an ugly scar on her cheek, the result of an accident at her work. The two pretty sisters are great favorites, enjoying social distinction, while drudgery and loneliness is the lot of poor Grace. We see the contrast on Saturday. Vivian and Daisy are getting ready to go to a party, and Grace is allowed to mope at home. Mother, however, urges Grace to go, and helps her to dress in a becoming frock. At the ball Vivian and Daisy are the center of attraction, engaging all the gallants' attention, but Grace remains the wallflower. The ball is over, and the poor girl would be allowed to leave without an escort, but Carl, the blind musician, gropes his way through the hall, and the girl, appreciating his social proscription from the experience of her own sad lot, offers him her hand to lead the way. In that grasp of the hands there is a communion of two pure souls and tender hearts. It is the enkindling of love between them, and they become sweethearts. Shortly afterwards their betrothal is announced, when a young doctor, upon examination, declares that Carl's sight can be restored, but it would require money to have it done, as the services of a specialist would be necessary. Now the poor fellow is more miserable than before, feeling that his cure is possible, yet he is without the necessary funds, as his engagements have only afforded him a bare living, and frugal as he might be he could not hope to accumulate sufficient to pay the doctor. Grace, however, has saved something and is at first elated with the idea to help him, but on viewing herself in the mirror she reasons that when the light comes he will see her as she is and she will then lose his love. Her hesitation is but for a moment, for the true heart is unselfish, and she at least can make him happy. The eminent doctor is employed, and his work is successful. But what a pathetic scene is the removing of the last bandage. He is in the seventh heaven of delight and calls for her. She at first is loath to show herself, fearing the consequences, but he does not consider her personal appearance, which is at best transitory, and which he now sees for the first time, but her heart, the purity of which he has known by intuition.::Moving Picture World synopsis

379;Les Misérables;1909;J. Stuart Blackton;5.8;Short Drama History;"The fourth, and last, of the famous scripts de luxe derived from incidents from Victor Hugo's ""Les Miserables."" In this the story is followed from the love of Marius and Cosette to the death of Jean, which ends the volume. M. Marius, grandson of M. Gillenormand, sees Cosette, Jean Valjean's foster-daughter, now grown into a beautiful girl, in the Luxembourg, and falls madly in love with her. Valjean, apprised of the love affair, refuses to give his consent, and Marius induces Cosette to marry him without parental sanction. Meanwhile Thenardier, once the keeper of the Inn of the Soldier of Waterloo at Montfermeil, but now reduced to dire straits in Paris, recognizes in a benevolent old man the visitor to the inn who removed the child Cosette and who must be the escaped convict, Jean Valjean. Playing upon his sympathy, Thenardier induces Jean to visit his apartment, and Marius, who occupies the next room because a quarrel with his grandfather has reduced him to want, overhears a part of the plot and rescues Jean by warning the police. Jean makes his escape and next encounters Marius at the barricade, where he releases Javert, the human bloodhound, who, through a score of years, has remorselessly hunted Jean. Gavriche, the gamin, is there, enjoying the battle until his brave sortie to rifle the cartouche boxes of the dead soldiers brings to an end his gay life and finds for him a place beside his dead sister, Eponine, whose love for Marius has led her to assume a boy's dress and follow him to the barricade. Jean learns of Marius's relations with Cosette and when the regulars carry the barricade he makes his escape into the sewer with the unconscious man upon his back. In the sewer he encounters Thenardier, who permits him to escape from the locked gate by means of a false key, at the same time cutting from Marius's trousers a portion of one leg as a means of identification. Later Thenardier's attempt to blackmail Marius clears away the cloud of suspicion that has hovered over Jean in Marius's mind, and he and Cosette hurry to Jean, whom they find dying of starvation and heartbreak, but happy at the sight of Cosette once more. The story has been slightly altered to give greater dramatic value to the scenes and clarity to the narrative, and the result is a release in keeping with the earlier sections of the same story, though, like the others, this story is in itself an interesting tale apart from the earlier releases.::Moving Picture World synopsis Jean Valjean, a good and decent man who has nevertheless been convicted of a crime, escapes incarceration and lives for years shadowed by the vindictive and merciless man of the law, Javert.::Jim Beaver <jumblejim@prodigy.net>"
380;The Life of Moliere;1910;Léonce Perret;5.6;Short Biography Drama;"We first see Moliere at work in his father's shop, when a boy. All the employees are busy at their appointed tasks, except the youthful playwright, who snatches time to re-read one of his earliest efforts. The door opens and the Italian comedian, Scaramouche, enters in quest of a particular style of chair. Moliere tenders his play for perusal; but, just as Scaramouche begins to be interested, Poquelin, the father of Moliere, comes in unexpectedly and the play is hastily thrown out of sight. Again the boy poet places it in the comedian's hand, and some clever work is done by Scaramouche, as he tries to read the manuscript without being detected by the stern upholsterer. The next scene shows Moliere at the Louvre palace, where he meets Louis XIV for the first time. Here we see the scorn of the courtiers for the actor-dramatist and the consideration shown for him by the King. This scene will be remembered for the delicate beauty of the interiors shown. Next we view the stately splendor of the festival at Versailles, where hundreds of courtiers, ladies in waiting and great nobles attend on Louis XIV. The beauty of the court costumes, which set the fashion for all the royal houses in Europe at that time, and the courtly air and demeanor of every individual in the royal pageant, have been faithfully reproduced. One cannot but marvel at the excellence of the training of this vast throng, every one of whom acts his or her part as if manor-born. We must take off our hats to this Gaumont producer. As Moliere comes into the scene, the acting of the King, the courtiers and of the great actor himself, is faultless. When the King places his arm around Moliere's shoulders and walks off with him, it is a delight to watch the faces of the surprised and jealous train of followers. And when next we see Louis seated at table with Moliere, serving him with his own hands, the cup of the courtiers is full. The scene showing the distraction of Moliere over the desertion of his wife is a pathetic picture and displays talented emotional acting. Then, when she appears before finally leaving him, and we watch the play of coquetry on her witching face and note her charm of manner and grace of deportment, we do not wonder at poor Moliere's abandonment to despair. The attempt of the faithful maid servant to arouse Moliere from his apathy and melancholia is a brilliant specimen of silent acting in both roles. The last appearance of Moliere, and his first in the role of Malade, is a fine depiction of the stage of the tennis court theater and of the French manner of acting a part in the seventeenth century. Then follow his sudden illness and death.::Moving Picture World synopsis"

382;The Mountaineer's Honor;1909;D.W. Griffith;5.7;Short Drama;A mountain girl is seduced by a traveler from the valley. Her brother tracks the seducer down and kills him. In retaliation, the sheriff captures the brother and prepares to lynch him. Mother intervenes and, to save her son the disgrace of hanging, shoots him.::Anonymous In the hills of old Kentucky death was always preferable to dishonor, and once there occurred a blot on the family's good name it was never effaced. Such, whose fate it befell to incur the tarnish, were shunned as moral lepers. This was the awful anticipation of the mother when she did the deed that terminates our story. The family, comprising mother, father, son and a harum-scarum daughter, knew nothing of the world outside the old blue hills where they lived. Their ways were simple and honest. The harum-scarum was loved by a humble mountain poet, but she, hare-brained, could not appreciate his candor. One evening a belated traveler from the valley calls and asks food and shelter for the night, and although they are at first inclined to turn him away. Harum-Scarum, no doubt struck with his manly appearance, induces them to accommodate him. The valley man at first is amused by the antics of the harum-scarum, and as he leaves in the morning is impressed by the fact that the little rattle-brained girl is in love with him. The consent to meet him is easily obtained, and during the husking dance she steals away to the spot selected. These clandestine meetings become regular occasions, until at last the brother's suspicion is aroused. He follows her on one of her journeys, and arrives just in time to see her cruelly deserted by her lover of the valleys. He questions her, but an answer is unnecessary, and drives her home, just as the old father comes into view over the rocks. The boy, unarmed, borrows the old man's revolver, and bolts off, leaving the father standing perplexed, for he is unaware of his motive. Following the valley man, he catches up with him as he enters the village. Here he demands that the man go back and right the wrong. His demand is refused and the valley man pays the penalty. The vigilance party are soon on the boy's trail and surround his borne. They are met by the old mother, who fights ferociously with them at the door. She is overpowered, however, and the sheriff finds the boy hidden in the fireplace. Taking him outside, the mother, who has revived, asks what they intend doing with him. He is to be hanged at once. Hanged! Oh, the ignominy of such an end. What a smirch to the family honor. Cunningly she contrives to avert this awful end. Begging the officer to be allowed to get her son a drink, she goes, and returns with a dipper of water. As he drinks, she shows him a pistol concealed beneath her apron. He nods assent, and it meant but a touch of the trigger to cheat the gibbet. The party, seeing their work anticipated, depart. At this point, the girl realizing that she is the cause of it all rushes out and falls prostrate on her dead brother, but the mother hurls her aside and, with an invective, casts her adrift. The humble mountain poet, still deeply in love with her, is more charitable, and blaming the stranger, and not the unsophisticated mountain girl, takes her in his arms and leads her away. We last see them making their way over the hills with the shades of night slowly shutting them from view.::Moving Picture World synopsis
383;Mr. Jones Has a Card Party;1909;D.W. Griffith;5.0;Short Comedy;"Mr. Jones, since his last escapade, had made strenuous efforts to amend the reputation he had gained in the eyes of the ladies of the Temperance League. But Oh! the ordeal, for such it was, was telling on him, and his pent-up spirits were threatening ebullition, when at last the chance comes. The league arranges to attend a three-days' convention out of town, and when Mrs. Jones departs, Jones sends a note to Smith, telling him to bring the gang, and they would have a ""Prayer Meeting,"" enjoining him not to forget the ""fixings."" Well, the gang are not long in putting in an appearance, for they feel that every minute's delay is a chunk lost from a golden opportunity for fun.

During this time the feminine nemesis of Rum, the League has arrived at the station just in time to see the train pull out. Madder than wet hens, they decide to pass the night with Mrs. Jones. ""Oh, horror! Oh horror! a couple of times."" Does not your sympathetic heart go out to poor unsuspecting Jones who in the meantime has gotten into a glorious condition, and the gang dress him in one of his wife's gowns, paint his face, carry him to the bedroom and throw him into bed, covering him up with the bedclothes. At this moment the prohibition party are seen approaching the house. The men hide as best they can the ""fixings,"" and are sitting reading books entitled ""Down with Rum"" when the ladies enter. They of course are delighted at this sight, and the absence of Jones is explained by a faked note calling him to attend a sick friend, noble Jones. The ladies go to the bedroom to remove their wraps, and their intrusion arouses Jones, who, not recognizing them, makes a dash for them, at which they all rush wildly into the drawing room, screaming that there is a madman in the bedroom. The men then rush in and while pretending to annihilate the imagined maniac they tidy up Jones and slip him through the window, that he may go around and enter the front door. The fright attending this episode has somewhat sobered him and everything would have been well had not Mrs. J. got a whiff of his breath. Even this would have passed, but Sister Anderson spies the bottles. Well, it's all off. It looks bad for Jones until the gang step forward and claim all the blame, as Jones was not even present. Here Jones makes the bluff and exclaims majestically. ""Madam, nimium de crede colori!"" or, in other words, ""Trust not to appearances."" and the bluff goes.::Moving Picture World synopsis"

Well, here is another incident where the verdure-eyed makes its appearance. A lady friend of Emma calls and leaves a very pretty bouquet of roses, and when Eddie arrives he wants to know where they came from. Mrs. J., incensed at his insinuating question, refuses to enlighten him. Her actions seem convincing, which situation is intensified by the finding of a strange hat in the hallway. As furious as an Othello he rushes about the house, with a sword in hand, to annihilate the perfidious traducer of his home. Mrs. Jones is now alarmed and would have explained if she could, but she was unable to account for the hat or the owner, who is subsequently found. The maid, however, holds the key to the mystery. She had broken a handsome vase and secretly brought in this workman to repair it. Hence the tragedy did not occur.::Moving Picture World synopsis

386;The Necklace;1909;D.W. Griffith;6.2;Short Drama;"Miss Louise Leroque was one of those charming young ladies, born, as if through an error of destiny, into a family of clerks, and after she married John Kendrick, she suffered an incessant yearning for all those delicacies and luxuries she felt were her due. John was a bighearted, indulgent husband whose every thought was for his wife's happiness, and while Louise was a devoted wife, still there was the strain of selfishness ever apparent, for she who studies her glass neglects her heart. She yearned for ostentation, and poor John was in no position to appease this desire. However, an occasion presents itself when they can at least bask in the radiance of the social limelight, in an invitation to attend a reception tendered a foreign prince. John is in the height of elation, hut Louise meets him with that time-honored remark, ""I've nothing to wear."" Well, he feels the strength of her argument, so goes and pawns his watch and chain to procure her a gown fitting for the occasion. The gown emphasizes the absence of jewel ornamentation, so they visit their friend and neighbor, who lends them a handsome necklace. At the reception she makes quite a stir and is presented to the prince, who becomes decidedly attentive. Arriving home after the affair, Louise rehearses the incidents of the event, when suddenly she stands petrified with horror. ""My God! The necklace is gone.""

But then there is the humiliation of not returning the jewels, so they hunt for a duplicate. At the jeweler's they find one, in appearance an exact copy, but the price is $20,000. Twenty thousand dollars to ones in their condition meant a large fortune. However, John borrows money on his salary, gets loans from his various friends and is granted a large advance by his employer, giving notes for same: in fact, mortgaging his very life as the result of vanity. With the money he purchases the duplicate and gives it to their friend, who is unaware of the substitution. Meanwhile, the thief has taken the necklace to a pawnshop and finds it is a worthless imitation, and so throws it into the rubbish heap. Five years later we find the couple toiling, toiling, but still in bondage; after night in the endeavor to make a little extra above his ordinary salary.

Twenty years, and the last penny on the necklace is paid, but at the expense of their bodily strength. Having cleared up his debt with his employer, he is discharged, being too feeble to do the work. As a last resort they write to their friend, confessing the substitution of the jewels, and their plight as a result, begging that she give them some slight assistance. Their friend, of course, is amazed, she cognizant of the worthlessness of her property, so hastens to give Louise back the jewels, arriving only in time to put them about her neck when she sinks back dead. John, poor fellow, is found sitting in a chair at the head of the bed, also dead.

Our story shows a party of the nobility endeavoring to evade the insurrectionists, but only one succeeds in outdistancing them.

Here he begs succor, which is granted, and he manages to elude his pursuers in the role of the aristocrat's servant. However, the riotous mob ransacks the house and grounds in a predatory manner, taking up quarters on the outside from which point to work deeds of lawlessness. It is not assumed that the hunted man adhered to his principles through loyalty or honor. No, he was rather the cowardly cur, as we shall see. Hardly ensconced in the house, he at once shows his despicable nature by questionable advances toward the wife of his savior. She, at first, does not realize the meaning of his attentions, assuming them to be an exaggerated show of gratitude, but it is not long before she awakens to the truth, and the timely arrival of her husband saves her from the viper's clutches.

Murray, on his rounds, runs into them and his suspicions are aroused, so he follows them and enters their hovel just in time to see the poor creature receiving a frightful beating. With a terrific blow he sends the man reeling to the floor and hurling the woman on top of him he seizes the child in his arms. At this moment a couple of his squad, in answer to his whistle, enter and take the Sicilians in charge. An idea dawns on him. He takes the little one home and presents her to his poor demented wife. The presence of the child at once restores her reason, so the clouds of sorrow are dissipated and happiness reigns. The picture presents a moral showing the singular working of God's justice in taking to Himself an unsullied soul that another might be saved.::Moving Picture World synopsis
