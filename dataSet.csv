130;Card Party;1896;Georges_Méliès;5.1;Short Biography;In what is considered to be the first remake in the history of cinema the grand French director Georges Méliès directs his very first short film influenced by the Lumière Brothers original story in Partie décarté 1896. Three friends are playing cards in a beer garden. One of them orders drinks. The waitress comes back with a bottle of wine and three glasses on a tray. The man serves his friends. They clink glasses and drink. Then the man asks for a newspaper. He reads a funny story in it and the three friends burst out laughing while the waitress merely smiles. In what is considered to be the first remake in the history of cinema the grand French director the prolific Georges Méliès directs his very first short film in his long and enviable list of movies. Influenced by the Lumière Brothers original story in Partie décarté 1896 Méliès reinterprets the storyline by reenacting an outdoor scene this time of two men playing cards and a third watching them. By bringing the centre of attention to the spectator played by himself and his mannerisms while reading the newspaper the director depicts a delightful easy afternoon and the leisure activities of three men enjoying the sun and their friendship over a refreshing glass of sparkling beer. Who cares whos winning the game. The first short ever directed by early film director Georges Méliès Card Party or Playing Cards depicts a carefree afternoon between three gentleman seated at a table at an outdoor restaurant. While the two men on the right and left of the screen are playing a game of cards the third character seated in the middle calls over a little girl to place an order for a bottle of winebeer. Returning shortly thereafter is an older woman who stands at the table as the game progresses watching and observing while the middle gentleman pours the drinks she has provided. Finally as the short ends the man in the middle reads a funny story in the newspaper which he has been so intent upon reading all this time and all three of them burst into laughter.;Octavie_Huvier Gaston_Méliès Georges_Méliès Georgette_Méliès

216;L'affaire Dreyfus;1899;Georges_Méliès;6.0;Short Biography Drama;Dramatized reenactments of the events of the Dreyfusaffair from 1894 to 1899. In a series of short docudrama episodes director Georges Méliès portrays the events of the Dreyfus affair political scandal which lasted from 18941906. First Captain Alfred Dreyfus is accused of treason to France when his handwriting is discovered to match that of the Bordereau. Sent to Devils Island the unfortunate officer spends his time within the Palisade outside his prison until hes put in leg irons due to innuendo published by an antiDreyfusard newspaper. Around the same time Major HubertJoseph Henry who admitted forging evidence against Dreyfus commits suicide in prison by the means of a razor concealed in his luggage. Because of this it is now decided Dreyfus must be tried again in Rennes where he is reunited with his wife during his imprisonment. Then several weeks before the trial the defense attorney Fernand Labori is attacked by an anonymous antiDreyfusard attacker who was never identified. Thankfully he survives in time to present his case. Finally since the antiDreyfusard claims are still at work the second trial again results in condemnation and because the elevenpart serial was made seven years before acquittal the director never managed to entirely depict the entire story. A lot is left to be desired after the final installment ends. The scandal of Dreyfus in more acts the arrest the imprisonment on the Devil s Island the imprisonment between the bars the suicide of Colonel Henry landing of Dreyfus at Quiberon  the meeting of Dreyfuss with his wife the attempt of the lawyer Labori the fight of the reporter the court martial in Rènnes.;Georges_Méliès

Suddenly he levels the glass on a young couple coming up the road. The girls shoe string came loose and her companion volunteers to tie it.

The couple who by the way caught Peeping Tom come toward him and as the young man passes behind him he knocks off his hat and kicks the stool on which he is sitting from under him making the old chap present a rather ludicrous appearance as he sits in the street.;NULL

285;The Clown and the Alchemist;1900;J._Stuart_Blackton Albert_E._Smith;5.0;Comedy Fantasy Short;Although we are led to believe that the ancient alchemists were all powerful this picture somewhat reverses the order of things. The clown plays some wonderful pranks on the old professor. He appears in numerous startling positions using his club with great effect and always escaping punishment. At last the alchemist brings his magic power into use and calling two hooded assistants orders a large cauldron brought in. The climax by which the clown finally disposes of the alchemist is startling in the extreme.;NULL

298;The Enchanted Drawing;1900;J._Stuart_Blackton;7.0;Animation Short Comedy Fantasy;A cartoonist defies reality when he draws objects that become threedimensional after he lifts them off his sketch pad. An easel holds a sketch pad upon which Blackton draws a cartoonish face of a man. He makes the cartoon react by giving it wine cigars and a top hat. Objects magically go into the drawingbecoming part of the cartoon image and out of the drawingbecoming physical objects again. From the father of American animation J. Stuart Blackton this mixture of a silent film and stopmotion animation brings the viewer in front of a large easel as the artist sketches the portrait of a fine gentleman in quick and bold strokes. As if by magic and much to our surprise the twodimensional objects on the canvas escape into our world assuming a real form as the facial expressions on the man in the picture succeed one another. Indeed this is an enchanted drawing.;J._Stuart_Blackton
